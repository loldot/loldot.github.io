# Update: How to use multiple Microsoft accounts without going insane

I no longer use Chrome for many reasons, most of which are not relevant here, but one of them is that Firefox official addon for [multi-account containers][1] is so much better than the Chrome experience. In stead of having to manage multiple windows, you can use different profiles for each tab. The tabs are marked with colors which makes it easy to see when you are in a different context. You can right click to open a link in a different container. Right clicking the new tab button also allows you to choose which container you want to work in. Never switching back to Chrome again.
