For the last couple of weeks I have had sort of an identity crisis. Working as a consultant, I have too many credentials for o365/azure/azure AD; being signed in to the right account at the right time has become impossible. Luckily there is a feature in chrome that will cure you of any virtual schizophrenia. If you click your name at the top of the title bar, you'll find a menu with a choice to manage people.

This will take you to a management screen that lets you add people you can switch between.

Now you'll be able to easily switch between your personalities. Each personality has its own private data, so your sessions will be completely separate. They also have a separate window with a custom icon so that it's easy to distinguish them from each other. Awesome!
