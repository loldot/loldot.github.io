IBM introduced FORTRAN, short for Formula Translating System, in 1956. Only a
few years behind Autocode, it wasone of the first compiled languages and
probably the first really popular compiled language. Compilers represented a
paradigm shift in computer programming, often referred to as automatic
programming. The inventor of Fortran, John Backus, describes automatic
programming as:

> Automatic programming techniques seek to make it easy to do a desired job
> on a computer. This is accomplished by providing a language in which the
> statement of the desired process is natural and concise, together with some
> means of causing a machine to carry out the stated process.
>
> &ndash; <cite>Backus, 1958 [1]</cite>

Before compilers, programmers would write assembly mnemonics on paper, use a
card punch machine to write the assembly to punched cards.

> Throughout my career in computing I have heard people claim that the solution to
> the software problem is automatic programming. All that one has to do is write
> the specifications for the software, and the computer will find a program.
>
> &hellip;
>
> In short, automatic programming always has been a euphemism for programming with
> a higher-level language than was then available to the programmer. Research in
> automatic programming is simply research in the implementation of higher-level
> programming languages.

> Experience with slow "automatic programming" systems, plus their own
> experience with the problems of organizing loops and address modification, had
> convinced program- mers that efficient programming was something that could
> not be automated. [&hellip;] closer inspection of these same systems would
> often reveal a complex, exception-ridden performer of clerical tasks which was
> both difficult to use and inefficient &ndash; <cite>Backus, 1978 [2]</cite>
