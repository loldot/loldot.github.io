Say you’re going somewhere you’ve never been before. Like my hometown, Bergen in Norway. And let’s say you go there during the winter. 

You read about Roald Amundsen. He’s a Norwegian. Bet he’s got some great insights on packing for the Norwegian winter. Sure, he went to Antarctica, but his ideas surely carry over to your trip to Norway - it’s practically the arctic. With some items added to your packing list and some good survival tips for the arctic climate, you decide to do some more research.

You come across the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. What a fantastic expedition. NASA sure knows how to handle the most extreme conditions. You’re guaranteed to learn something that could be applied to your expedition to Bergen. Winter there is of course not as hostile as the environment  on the moon, but it never hurts to be on the safe side. Maybe you should get a space suit? No - that would be silly. They’re really cool  though. Maybe you should pick one up and experiment with it. You never know when that knowledge might come in handy.

You pack your bags. Prepared for whatever the harsh, Norwegian nature can bring, you go to the airport. 

When you finally get to Bergen, you’re too warm and move slowly because your backpack is 50kg, and to be honest you didn’t have time to do the required workout beforehand, so you’re really exhausted. Worst of all: No one thinks you look smart and well prepared in your polar expedition gear. You look like a dumb cruise tourist.
