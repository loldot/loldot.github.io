I have meant to give an update on the previous post for a long while, but never got aroundt to it. I no longer use Chrome for many reasons, most of which are not relevant here, but one of them is that Firefox official addon for [multi-account containers][1] is so much better than the Chrome experience. In stead of having to manage multiple windows, you can use different profiles for each tab. The tabs are marked with colors which makes it easy to see when you are in a different context. You can right click to open a link in a different container. Right clicking the new tab button also allows you to choose which container you want to work in. I'll also be the first to admit that the UX around multiple Microsoft accounts have improved alot since the original post, but I still like the Firefox extension. I use this for lots of other things now as well, i.e. logging in as different test users etc. Never switching back to Chrome again.
